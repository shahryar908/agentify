\begin{abstract}
This paper addresses the critical challenge of robust prompt engineering for language models (LMs), focusing on two key areas: handling symmetry breaking in prompt structures and quantifying uncertainty in LM responses. Current prompt engineering techniques often assume idealized prompt structures, neglecting the impact of subtle variations or "symmetry breaking" that can significantly affect LM performance. Furthermore, many approaches lack a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty associated with LM outputs, hindering their reliability in critical applications. We propose a novel methodology that combines adversarial prompt generation with Bayesian inference to address these limitations. Our approach involves systematically perturbing prompts to identify vulnerabilities and then using Bayesian methods to estimate the uncertainty in LM predictions. We expect our method to improve the robustness and reliability of LMs, particularly in scenarios where prompt structures are imperfect or noisy. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LMs and expand their applicability to a wider range of real-world problems.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Context}
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, and question answering. A crucial aspect of effectively utilizing these models is prompt engineering, which involves crafting specific input prompts to guide the LM towards the desired output. The quality and structure of the prompt significantly influence the LM's performance. However, current prompt engineering techniques often rely on intuition and trial-and-error, lacking a systematic approach to ensure robustness and reliability.

The performance of LMs is highly sensitive to the precise wording and structure of the input prompt. Even small changes in the prompt can lead to significant variations in the generated output. This sensitivity poses a challenge for deploying LMs in real-world applications, where prompt structures may be imperfect or subject to noise. Furthermore, many existing prompt engineering methods do not adequately address the issue of uncertainty quantification. It is essential to understand the confidence level associated with LM predictions, especially in critical applications where incorrect outputs can have serious consequences.

\subsection{Problem Statement and Motivation}
The primary problem addressed in this paper is the lack of robust prompt engineering techniques that can effectively handle symmetry breaking in prompt structures and quantify uncertainty in LM responses. Symmetry breaking refers to subtle variations or perturbations in the prompt that can disrupt the intended meaning or structure, leading to degraded performance. This can arise from various sources, such as grammatical errors, ambiguous wording, or unexpected input formats. The absence of a systematic approach to address symmetry breaking limits the reliability and generalizability of LMs.

Furthermore, the inability to quantify uncertainty in LM predictions hinders their adoption in critical applications where risk assessment is paramount. Without a measure of confidence, it is difficult to determine the trustworthiness of LM outputs and make informed decisions based on them. Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel prompt engineering techniques that can both mitigate the effects of symmetry breaking and provide reliable uncertainty estimates.

\subsection{Research Objectives and Questions}
The main objectives of this research are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a methodology for systematically identifying and mitigating the effects of symmetry breaking in prompt structures.
    \item To develop a framework for quantifying the uncertainty associated with LM responses to different prompts.
    \item To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on a range of benchmark datasets and real-world applications.
\end{enumerate}

The key research questions addressed in this paper are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can we systematically identify vulnerabilities in prompt structures that lead to symmetry breaking?
    \item How can we quantify the uncertainty associated with LM predictions given different prompts?
    \item How does the proposed methodology compare to existing prompt engineering techniques in terms of robustness and reliability?
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of related work in prompt engineering and uncertainty quantification. Section 3 describes the proposed methodology, including the adversarial prompt generation and Bayesian inference framework. Section 4 presents the expected results and evaluation metrics.

Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the contributions and significance.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Review of Existing Approaches}
Existing prompt engineering techniques can be broadly categorized into manual prompt design, automated prompt optimization, and prompt-based learning. Manual prompt design involves crafting prompts based on human intuition and domain expertise. This approach is often time-consuming and requires significant effort to fine-tune the prompt for optimal performance. Automated prompt optimization methods, such as gradient-based search and reinforcement learning, aim to automatically discover effective prompts by exploring the prompt space. These methods can be more efficient than manual design but may suffer from instability and lack of interpretability. Prompt-based learning involves training LMs on a large corpus of prompts and corresponding outputs, allowing the model to learn generalizable prompt engineering strategies.

Several studies have explored the use of adversarial examples to evaluate the robustness of LMs. These studies typically involve generating small perturbations to the input text that can cause the LM to produce incorrect outputs. However, most of these studies focus on adversarial attacks on the input text itself, rather than on the prompt structure.

Uncertainty quantification in LMs has been addressed using various techniques, including Bayesian neural networks, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble methods. Bayesian neural networks provide a principled framework for estimating the posterior distribution over model parameters, allowing for uncertainty estimates to be derived from the posterior predictive distribution. Monte Carlo dropout involves applying dropout during both training and inference to approximate Bayesian inference. Ensemble methods involve training multiple LMs on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions to obtain a more robust and reliable estimate.

\subsection{Limitations of Current Methods}
Current prompt engineering methods have several limitations. First, they often assume idealized prompt structures and do not adequately address the issue of symmetry breaking. Second, many approaches lack a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty associated with LM outputs. Third, automated prompt optimization methods can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to new tasks or domains. Fourth, adversarial attacks on LMs typically focus on the input text itself, rather than on the prompt structure.

\subsection{Positioning of this Work}
This work aims to address the limitations of existing prompt engineering methods by developing a novel methodology that combines adversarial prompt generation with Bayesian inference. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities in prompt structures that lead to symmetry breaking and provides a framework for quantifying the uncertainty associated with LM predictions. By addressing these limitations, we aim to improve the robustness and reliability of LMs and expand their applicability to a wider range of real-world problems.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Detailed Proposed Approach}
Our proposed methodology consists of two main components: adversarial prompt generation and Bayesian inference. The adversarial prompt generation component aims to systematically identify vulnerabilities in prompt structures that lead to symmetry breaking. The Bayesian inference component aims to quantify the uncertainty associated with LM responses to different prompts.

\subsection{Technical Framework and Architecture}
The adversarial prompt generation component involves generating small perturbations to the prompt structure and evaluating the impact on LM performance. We use a gradient-based optimization technique to generate adversarial prompts that maximize the difference between the desired output and the actual output produced by the LM. The objective function for the adversarial prompt generation is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{arg max}_{\delta} L(f(x + \delta), y)
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the original prompt, $\delta$ is the perturbation, $f$ is the LM, $y$ is the desired output, and $L$ is a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the desired output.

The Bayesian inference component involves estimating the posterior distribution over LM parameters given the observed data. We use a variational inference approach to approximate the posterior distribution. The variational posterior is parameterized by a set of variational parameters, which are optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the variational posterior and the true posterior. The objective function for the variational inference is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{arg min}_{q} KL(q(w) || p(w|D))
\end{equation}

where $q(w)$ is the variational posterior, $p(w|D)$ is the true posterior, and $D$ is the observed data.

\subsection{Experimental Design and Evaluation Setup}
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on a range of benchmark datasets and real-world applications. We compare the performance of the proposed methodology to existing prompt engineering techniques, including manual prompt design, automated prompt optimization, and prompt-based learning. We use a variety of evaluation metrics to assess the robustness and reliability of the different methods, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and uncertainty estimates.

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis Methods}
We collect data from a variety of sources, including publicly available datasets and real-world applications. We use standard data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis. We use statistical methods to analyze the data and evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology.
